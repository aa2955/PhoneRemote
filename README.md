# PhoneRemote

PhoneRemote is an application that allows you to use your iPhone as a remote mouse for your Windows computer. With PhoneRemote, you can control your computer's mouse from the comfort of your bed using a touchpad interface on your phone.
P.S. I made this because I did not have a bluetooth mouse and my laptop is connected to a big monitor which acts as a TV. Soooo this was made out of pure laziness. Enjoy! 

## Features

- **Touchpad Control**: Use your iPhone's screen as a touchpad to move the mouse pointer on your computer.
- **Double-Tap to Click**: Tap on the touchpad to perform a left-click. Double tap works as well. (I tried it on 2 devices where single tap worked for one and double for the other)
- **Easy Connection**: Connect your iPhone to your computer using a QR code.
